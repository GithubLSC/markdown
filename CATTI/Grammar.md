[用法](http://www.360doc.com/content/18/0719/18/6354388_771716241.shtml)

as + adj + a +n + as ...

1. 和 ... 一样

2. 尽可能

  2. The trial began almost two months after the assassination. 
  3. But more than two months after the earthquake, many Haitians appear to still need urgent help finding food. 
  4. Instagram reached the 1 million users mark in just three **months** after its October 2010 launch.

> 零介词 + 时间段 + after + 时间点、事件名词、从句：用于句中修饰谓语动词，说明谓语动词在“时间段过去之后” 那个点位开始发生。例如，第1句的 died two months after coming to Britain，是指 “在来到英国两个月后死亡”，切不可翻译为 “两个月内死亡”。其他两句也是一样。

用作时间状语的关系副词when通常不能省略，但有一种特殊情况，即用于day, month，year, time等少数几个词后时可以省略(也可换成that)。如：

I'll never forget the day (that) we met.
The second time (that) I saw him was in 2000.
I don't know the exact time (when/ that) the sports meeting will take place.
